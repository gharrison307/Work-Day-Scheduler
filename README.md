## Module4challenge

## Description

[Project Screenshot](./assets/READMEJPEG.JPG)

This is the fifth module challenge of bootcamp. Using the starter code, I added JavaScript code to allow the user to save meeting information in the local storage of the browser. Additionally, the browser will adjust the colors of each time block to reflect whether the timeblock is the current timeblock (red), a past timeblock (gray), or a future timeblock (green).
